    <p class="intro1"> This page is to give feedback on how the website which you are currently on was created, 
    the issues encountered, corrective measures taken and how I came up with the layout of each page.
     Each page contains an html which is linked to a main css, desktop css and mobile css. In total,
      this website contains seven html’s. </p>

    <p class="intro2">This is the first time creating a website so there were lot of trial and errors. 
        The first two websites I coded didn’t turn out well, so I had to start afresh. Programming the 
        first and second website, the aims and objectives weren’t properly followed especially the part
        of committing. I committed only twice, had only one branch and so many css’s making it hard to
         keep track of my work. </p>

    <p class="intro3">After making so many mistakes like I said, I decided to start again but the two drafts which I had 
        done before made it easier and faster for me. Creating the current the site, I decided to make 
        research on how I wanted my site to look like, then I came across this Emily’s page. With the help 
        of Emily’s page, I was able to come up with ideas on how my page will look like.
